                  C ++ Programming Assessment Test

• Create a Project to demonstrate an Event Organiser Project which will help to manage the Events.
 The Project should contain all the necessary requirements i.e need to use conditional Statements, Loops, Function and also A Program should use the concept of OOP.

• Give comments where it is required , for better understanding of codes.
  It will help you and the project evaluator.

• A Project should contain the following execution flow.

• When Execution of the main source file, the program should first ask the NAME OF THE EVENT.


1. Example : Wedding

2. After asking the event name , it should ask your
I. FIRST NAME,LAST NAME.
II. Number of Guests.
III. Number of Minutes.

3. Once the all the Input requirement is over, you should be able to get the Event Cost Estimation.

 Use the following rate card :

a. const double CostPerHour = 18.50;
b. const double CostPerMinute = .40;
c. const double CostOfDinner = 20.70;

i. GET Number of Servers.
 (1 Server can handle 20 guests, so FIND how much server required for No. of Guests you Entered.) (Hint : You can use ceil() function . (i.e : rounds up the nearest integer)

ii. GET COST of ONE Server.
    Example :
        Cost1 = (NumberOfMinutes / 60) * CostPerHour;
        Cost2 = (NumberOfMinutes % 60) * CostPerMinute;
        CostForOneServer = Cost1 + Cost2;

iii. GET COST for FOOD.
        otalFoodCost = NumberOfGuests * CostOfDinner;

iv. Get Average Cost Per Person
        AverageCost = TotalFoodCost / NumberOfGuests;

v. GET TOTAL COST.
        TotalCost = TotalFoodCost + (CostForOneServer * NumberOfServers);

vi. GET DEPOSIT AMOUNT
        DepositAmount = TotalCost * .25;
